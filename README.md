# 3D-Facial-Modeling
## To discover and analysis existing facial modeling methods. 
ยง implementations of the modeling method
ยง necessary testing and verification
### Trimming of the input photo (this presentation) ยง 
  --- half-length photo -> passport photo
### Reconstructing 3D facial photo
  --- Facial feature locating and depth mapping
