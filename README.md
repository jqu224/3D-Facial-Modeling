# 3D-Facial-Modeling
The goal of this project is to discover and analysis existing facial modeling methods. Also, other than implementations of the modeling method, the team found that testing and verification are necessary for not only the project completeness but also the functional completeness. However, the testing and verification of the result could be challenging and time-consuming.
